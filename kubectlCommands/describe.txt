Show details of a specific resource or group of resources.

 Print a detailed description of the selected resources, including related resources such as events or controllers. You may select a single object by name, all objects of that type, provide a name prefix, or label selector. For example:

  $ kubectl describe TYPE NAME_PREFIX
  
 will first check for an exact match on TYPE and NAME_PREFIX. If no such resource exists, it will output details for every resource that has a name prefixed with NAME_PREFIX.

Use "kubectl api-resources" for a complete list of supported resources.

Examples:
  # Describe a node
  kubectl describe nodes kubernetes-node-emt8.c.myproject.internal
  
  # Describe a pod
  kubectl describe pods/nginx
  
  # Describe a pod identified by type and name in "pod.json"
  kubectl describe -f pod.json
  
  # Describe all pods
  kubectl describe pods
  
  # Describe pods by label name=myLabel
  kubectl describe po -l name=myLabel
  
  # Describe all pods managed by the 'frontend' replication controller
  # (rc-created pods get the name of the rc as a prefix in the pod name)
  kubectl describe pods frontend

Options:
  -A, --all-namespaces=false: If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
      --chunk-size=500: Return large lists in chunks rather than all at once. Pass 0 to disable. This flag is beta and may change in the future.
  -f, --filename=[]: Filename, directory, or URL to files containing the resource to describe
  -k, --kustomize='': Process the kustomization directory. This flag can't be used together with -f or -R.
  -R, --recursive=false: Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
  -l, --selector='': Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
      --show-events=true: If true, display events related to the described object.

Usage:
  kubectl describe (-f FILENAME | TYPE [NAME_PREFIX | -l label] | TYPE/NAME) [options]

Use "kubectl options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
