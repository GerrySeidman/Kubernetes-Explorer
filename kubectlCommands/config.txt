Modify kubeconfig files using subcommands like "kubectl config set current-context my-context"

 The loading order follows these rules:

  1.  If the --kubeconfig flag is set, then only that file is loaded. The flag may only be set once and no merging takes place.
  2.  If $KUBECONFIG environment variable is set, then it is used as a list of paths (normal path delimiting rules for your system). These paths are merged. When a value is modified, it is modified in the file that defines the stanza. When a value is created, it is created in the first file that exists. If no files in the chain exist, then it creates the last file in the list.
  3.  Otherwise, ${HOME}/.kube/config is used and no merging takes place.

Available Commands:
  current-context Display the current-context
  delete-cluster  Delete the specified cluster from the kubeconfig
  delete-context  Delete the specified context from the kubeconfig
  delete-user     Delete the specified user from the kubeconfig
