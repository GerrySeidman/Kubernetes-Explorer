Experimental: Display events

 Prints a table of the most important information about events. You can request events for a namespace, for all namespace, or filtered to only those pertaining to a specified resource.

Examples:
  # List recent events in the default namespace.
  kubectl alpha events
  
  # List recent events in all namespaces.
  kubectl alpha events --all-namespaces
  
  # List recent events for the specified pod, then wait for more events and list them as they arrive.
  kubectl alpha events --for pod/web-pod-13je7 --watch

Options:
  -A, --all-namespaces=false: If present, list the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
      --chunk-size=500: Return large lists in chunks rather than all at once. Pass 0 to disable. This flag is beta and may change in the future.
      --for='': Filter events to only those pertaining to the specified resource.
  -w, --watch=false: After listing the requested events, watch for more events.

Usage:
  kubectl alpha events [--for TYPE/NAME] [--watch] [options]

Use "kubectl options" for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
